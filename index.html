  <br>
  I decided to go into politics in order to save my fellow Nigerian Citizens and to see that Nigeria takes her place in the comity of nations.
  I started following the political events in Nigeria since 1979 elections which was dominated by the NPN and UPN political parties. I observed that all the past political parties failed Nigeria due to their greed and deceit.
